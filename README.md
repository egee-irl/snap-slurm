## Usage

Upon installation this snap only runs munged until configured to run in a supported `snap.mode`.

The following `snap.mode`'s are supported:
* slurmdbd
* slurmctld
* slurmd
* slurmrestd
* all
* none

To configure this snap to run a different Slurm daemon, just set the `snap.mode`:
```bash
sudo snap set slurm snap.mode=all
```
The above command configures this snap to run in `all` mode (this runs all of the Slurm daemons in a all in one local development mode.)

`all` mode is a core feature of this software, as there currently exists no other way to provision a fully functioning slurm cluster for development use.
